This program is used to simulate a farm.

The superclass FarmAnimal has the subclasses Chicken, Cow, and Duck.
FarmAnimal has pricate attributes for name, gender, weight, and age.
It also has a constructor method, along with getters and setters.
FarmAnimal has a method feedLoadingSchedule(), which outputs the
feeding schedule for animals. It ends with a toString method.

Chicken, Cow, and Duck are subclasses of FarmAnimal. Each one has
a private String sound, along with their own constructor, getter
and setter. They all override the feedLoadingSchedule method, as 
only the animal knows its own feeding schedule. They also have a
toString.

The main method MyFarm initializes the methods from FarmAnimal. It
creates a list with all of the animals, then uses loops to print 
out the animal sounds, animal identification, and the animal
feeding schedules.
