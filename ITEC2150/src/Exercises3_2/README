This program is used to simulate things that fly. The interface
Flight cointains one void method fly.

Airplane is a subclass of Flight, and has the private attributes
String model and int yearBuilt, along with a constructor, getters
and setters. It has a fly method that overrides the method from
Flight, which describes how the airplane flies. It ends with a
toString method to describe the model and year.

Bird is a subclass of Flight, and has the private attribute String
type, along with a constructor, getter and setter. It has a fly 
method that overrides the method from Flight, which describes how 
the bird flies. It ends with a toString method to describe the
bird type.

The main method ThingsThatFly is used to initialize the other
methods in the Exercises3_2 package. It contains a flight object
list, before creating a new Airplane and two Bird objects, adding 
them to the list. There is a for loop that prints out the toString
methods and the fly description.
