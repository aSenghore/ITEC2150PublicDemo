ProductSales, Sale, and DiscountSale take an item that you would like to purchase, provide you with a discount, then tell you about the
effects of the discount. You are told whether or not the prices are equal, whether or not the discounted price was equal to the original
price, whether or not the new price is greater than the original, and if it is less than the original. 
Sale is a superclass, and DiscountSale is a subclass of Sale. ProductSales is used to run Sale.
